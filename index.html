    <p>Springtime in <a href="https://www.michigan.org/city/ann-arbor">Ann Arbor</a> is a popular university town, culinary hot spot, and tech hub with a walkable and accessible downtown.
      Experience the University of Michigan, globally inspired dining, unique retail and world-class arts and culture.</p>

    <p>Sometimes we walk around the neighborhood, other times we make it to the woods. Ann Arbor also has some
      beautiful lakes and rivers including the <a
        href="https://www.annarbor.org/things-to-do/recreation-outdoors/huron-river/">Huron River Watertrail</a> and
      the <a href="https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/parks-places/argo/pages/default.aspx">Argo Park
        Cascades</a>.</p>
